# Hexagon
This is the front end code for a two player version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)"> hexagon </a> board game. The game is available to play at
https://ebkeefe5.github.io/Hexagon/. One player creates a game, which generates a join code. The second player can then use that join code to join the game. It's also possible to play yourself on two tabs, by creating a game
and then joining in a seperate tab.
